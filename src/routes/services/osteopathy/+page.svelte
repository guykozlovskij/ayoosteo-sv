    <h1>Medical Acupuncture</h1>
    <p>
      Western medical acupuncture, or dry needling, is a beneficial adjunct to
      osteopathic treatment in managing and rehabilitating patients with pain,
      inflammation, muscle spasms, and tension. It is used in many NHS general
      practices, private clinics, and pain clinics in the UK as a complement to
      conventional medicine.
