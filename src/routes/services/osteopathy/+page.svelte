    <p>
      Osteopaths are commonly known for treating back pain. The National
      Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends osteopathy for the
      treatment of low back pain and sciatica (2016). But! Osteopaths treat more
      than just backs.
    </p>
    <p class="italic">You can visit an osteopath for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any joint and arthritic pain (that includes the neck, shoulder, elbow,
        wrist, rib and chest, pelvic and hip, knee, ankle, foot)
      </li>
      <li>Headaches (Cervicogenic), Migraine prevention</li>
      <li>Muscle spasms, muscle aches</li>
      <li>Cramps</li>
      <li>Rheumatic pain</li>
      <li>Sports injuries</li>
      <li>Circulatory problems</li>
      <li>Digestion problems</li>
      <li>Neuralgia</li>
      <li>Fibromyalgia</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As primary healthcare practitioners, osteopaths also provide heath
      screening, advice and onward referrals. During your consultation and your
      treatments sessions an osteopath will continually screen and identify
      where patients may need an onward referral for more specialist
      investigation.
