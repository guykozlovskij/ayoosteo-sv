    <p style="font-style: italic">"The greatest wealth is health." – Virgil</p>
    <p>
      I work with clients from all around the globe, providing personalised
      guidance that fits your unique needs and lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are ready to take charge of your health—without the overwhelm—then
      you are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is your space to feel heard, supported, and empowered. No judgment.
      No one-size-fits-all plans. Just real, sustainable changes that fit YOUR
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a health coach, I don’t believe in quick fixes or generic advice.
      Instead, we’ll work together to build habits that support your whole
      health—whether that means managing a condition, improving energy, reducing
      pain, or just feeling like yourself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      You already have the ability to make positive changes. My job is to guide,
      support, and help you break through resistance so you can create a
      lifestyle that works for you, not against you.
