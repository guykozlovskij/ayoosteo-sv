    <h1>Heat or Cold for Pain?</h1>
    <p>
      Addressing the great confusion when youâ€™re in pain! Should I use Heat,
      Cold or both?
    </p>
    <p>Well in nutshell:</p>
    <p>
      <span class="article-bold">Cold</span> for inflammation to decrease blood flow.
    </p>
    <ul class="article-unordered-list">
      <li>Recent injuries (especially if you notice any swelling)</li>
      <li>Good for osteoarthritis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span class="article-bold">Heat</span> promotes blood flow and helps muscles
      to relax.
    </p>
    <ul class="article-unordered-list">
      <li>Great for chronic pain</li>
      <li>Muscle ache and stiffness</li>
      <li>Good for general stiffness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Or even both. <span class="article-bold">Heat and Cold</span>: Changing
      tissue temperature from hot to cold hence forcing it to adapt to sudden
      changes.
    </p>
    <ul class="article-unordered-list">
      <li>
        Usually great for repetitive strain injuries (Tennis elbow, Carpal
        tunnel syndrome, Shin splints, Achilles Tendonitis, Plantar fasciitis)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are still not sure what would work for you please ask your physical
      therapist or email me any questions you may have.
    </p>
    <p>Hope this helps,</p>
