    <h1>What is the difference between an Osteopath and a Physiotherapist?</h1>
    <p>
      So you are in pain, and you go to a clinic and find both physiotherapist
      and osteopath within the same practice, treating the same conditions with
      the goal to reduce pain, improve mobility and improve better quality of
      life. <span class="article-bold">What is the difference?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="article-bold">Approach: </span>Physiotherapists usually have
      treatment protocols for treating specific problems, while osteopathic
      treatment is tailored to the individual not the symptom(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="article-bold">Treatment: </span>Physiotherapists techniques
      vary from soft tissue techniques such as massage, rehabilitation exercise
      programs to passive joint movement. Modalities like ultrasound,
      electrotherapy and hydrotherapy is also usually employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Osteopathic treatments vary from soft tissue techniques like massage,
      passive joint movements and thrust techniques (commonly referred to as
      “cracking”), with lifestyle and postural advices and exercises. However
      many osteopaths are also known to use ultrasound, hydrotherapy, western
      acupuncture and other equipment you may find a physiotherapist using. So
      for example if you have lower back pain:Both a physiotherapist and
      osteopath will examine, diagnose, form a treatment plan and treat you
      hands on. However you generally get more hands on treatment from an
      osteopath because osteopaths take into account the interrelationship
      between the nervous system, musculo-skeletal system and even your
      psychological health, so they may treat your diaphragm, upper back, hips
      and your lower limbs when you have lower back pain. I say all of these but
      in reality there are differences in the ways practitioners within both
      professions treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treatment and approach can vary between individuals within the same
      professions. So some physiotherapists may treat like osteopaths and vice
      versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="article-bold">Cost: </span>In the UK, physiotherapy is very
      popular within the NHS. You can get a referral via your GP, hospital
      doctors and surgeons to visit a physiotherapist, so it’d be free.In
      private practice, average cost to see a physiotherapist or an osteopath is
      about the same.So what is really important is YOU. As long as:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-unordered-list">
      <li>
        You have a consultation with the practitioner where you have the freedom
        to express yourself, you feel listened to and understood
      </li>
      <li>
        An effective case history, clinical examination and diagnosis is carried
        out by the practitioner
      </li>
      <li>The diagnosis and course of action is explained to you</li>
      <li>You feel comfortable with the practitioner</li>
      <li>You are receiving effective treatment with exercise and advice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then you have found the right practitioner and the right clinic regardless
      of whether it’s an osteopath or a physiotherapist.I hope this helps. If
      you have any questions or suggestions for the next post, feel free to ask
