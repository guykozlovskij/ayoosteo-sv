      Addressing the great confusion when you’re in pain! Should I use Heat,
      Cold or both? Well in nutshell: Cold for inflammation to decrease blood
      flow Recent injuries (especially if you notice any swelling) Good for
      osteoarthritis Heat promotes blood flow and helps muscles to relax. Great
      for chronic pain Muscle ache and stiffness Good for...

    <p class="blog-preview">
      2 months ago I picked up a hula-hoop and I could not get it to stay up.
      This time I was a little frustrated because regardless of how often I
      stretched and exercised, the range of motion I could introduce to my
      pelvis and hip was still limited. So guess what I did, I went out during
      my...

      What is the difference between an Osteopath and a Physiotherapist?
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-preview">
      So you are in pain, and you go to a clinic and find both physiotherapist
      and osteopath within the same practice, treating the same conditions with
      the goal to reduce pain, improve mobility and improve better quality of
      life.What is the difference? Approach: Physiotherapists usually have
      treatment protocols for treating specific problems, while osteopathic
      treatment is tailored to the individual not the symptom(s).

    <p class="blog-preview">
      After the facial and/or audible reaction to “pop”/”crack” sound of an
      adjustment, I’m almost always asked the question “What causes that
      pop/crack noise” and “is it safe?” Well don’t worry, the sound is not
      actually your spine or joint “popping” or “cracking”. The actual pop/crack
      is called a cavitation.The result of the noise is quite similar to the...

      What’s the difference between an Osteopath and a Chiropractor?

      If I had a penny for the amount of times I’ve been asked this question,
      I’d definitely be able to afford that car I’ve been eyeing. The main
      difficulty with answering this question is that there are differences in
      the ways practitioners within both professions treat. Some osteopaths
      practice closer to the chiropractic way and some...

    <h2 class="blog-title">Do Osteopaths treat headaches?</h2>
    <p class="blog-preview">
      I had this question from a patient recently and the answer is YES. But it
      depends on the cause of your headaches, as headaches can be primary or
      secondary to a separate condition.Generally the types of headache
      osteopaths treat are the ones related to your muscles and spinal posture
      for example tension headaches. Your first appointment...

    <h2 class="blog-title">What is Osteopathy?</h2>
    <p class="blog-preview">
      Osteopathy is a health care system based upon finding and treating the
      cause of a disease or injury rather than only attempting to address
      symptoms. Pain is a symptom, not a disease.So addressing the origin of
      what is causing the pain is always the goal of osteopathic treatment.
      Sometimes pain overlaps with the cause so when...

    <p class="blog-preview">
      Osteopathic treatment is not merely about the techniques; it is a
      philosophy of healthcare based on guiding principles. Osteopathy is a vast
      art and science that is open to many interpretations but there are a set
      of core principles that expresses our distinctiveness as Osteopaths. This
      post is a summary of Stephen Paulus’s article in...
