      2 months ago I picked up a hula-hoop and I could not get it to stay up.
      This time I was a little frustrated because regardless of how often I
      stretched and exercised, the range of motion I could introduce to my
      pelvis and hip was still limited. So guess what I did!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out during my lunch break, literally hunted down a hula-hoop and
      practiced everyday. You might think I’m crazy (and you might be right) but
      I am proud of what I achieved in the past 2 month.

      Did you know that waist hooping can work up to 30 muscles? Hula-hooping
      not only helped me achieve my goal of better pelvic and hip mobility, I
      experienced many more benefits like stronger glutes (buttocks), hips and
      abdominal muscles. It also builds neural connections, which improves
      hand-eye coordination and most importantly for me it’s a lot of fun.

      I am not trying to advertise hula-hooping to you, but I am trying to
      encourage you to <span class="article-bold">try a new activity</span>, it
      could be hula-hooping or trying a new class at the gym. Get out of your
      comfort zone and try a new activity and you just might like it!
