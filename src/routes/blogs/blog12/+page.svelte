      The Shorter Your Sleep, The Shorter Your Lifespan: How to Improve Your
      Sleep Hygiene
    </h1>
    <p>
      Sleep is a cornerstone of health, yet many adults struggle to get the
      recommended 7–9 hours per night. Poor sleep is linked to a range of health
      issues, from weakened immunity to increased risk of chronic diseases. If
      you’re finding it difficult to get quality rest, it may be time to
      evaluate your sleep hygiene.
    </p>
    <h2>The Foundation of Good Sleep Hygiene</h2>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Start with the basics:</strong></p>
    <ul class="article-unordered-list">
      <li>
        Maintain a consistent sleep schedule – Going to bed and waking up at the
        same time each day, including weekends, helps regulate your circadian
        rhythm and improves overall sleep quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a bedtime routine – Engaging in relaxing activities before bed
        signals to your body that it’s time to wind down.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Factors That Influence Sleep</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Several factors can make or break your sleep quality. Consider the
      following:
    </p>
    <ol class="article-ordered-list">
      <li>
        Lighting
        <ul class="article-unordered-list">
          <li>
            Dimming lights in the evening signals your body to produce
            melatonin, the sleep hormone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid bright overhead lights close to bedtime to help ease your
            transition into sleep.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Screen Time
        <ul class="article-unordered-list">
          <li>
            Blue light from screens can suppress melatonin production and
            disrupt sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce exposure to screens at least an hour before bed, or use
            blue-light-blocking settings or glasses if needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Sleep Environment
        <ul class="article-unordered-list">
          <li>
            Use blackout curtains or an eye mask to eliminate disruptive light.
          </li>
          <li>
            A quiet, dark, and comfortable bedroom creates the ideal sleep
            environment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Room Temperature
        <ul class="article-unordered-list">
          <li>
            A cooler bedroom, ideally around 15–19°C, promotes better
            sleep.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pre-Bedtime Habits
        <ul class="article-unordered-list">
          <li>
            Taking a warm bath or shower before bed helps your body cool down
            naturally, making it easier to fall asleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid drinking large amounts of fluids in the evening to prevent
            waking up frequently during the night.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Troubleshooting Sleep Challenges</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you’re still struggling to get restful sleep, consider these additional
      strategies:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul class="article-unordered-list">
      <li>
        Caffeine timing – Try to avoid coffee, tea, energy drinks, and fizzy
        drinks at least 8–10 hours before bedtime to prevent disruptions to your
        sleep cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dinner timing – Experiment with different meal times and food choices to
        determine what best supports your sleep. Some people find that eating
        too close to bedtime affects their ability to fall asleep, while others
        sleep better with a light snack.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you've tried these strategies but still experience poor sleep, it may
      be time to seek professional guidance. Sleep is too important to ignore,
      and small adjustments can lead to profound improvements in your overall
      health and well-being.
